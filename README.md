I observed the effects of various factors on the **inflight satisfaction percentage** (IFS). IFS is calculated based on the ratings provided by the passengers. In this analysis, I only considered the categories that had a significant amount of responses (more than 50). The final analysis of the **comments** and **ratings** has been submitted.

### Inflight Satisfaction
IFS is a metric used to quantify the passengers satisfaction based on the ratings they have provided  
% Inflight Satisfaction = Satisfied Sample/Total Sample*100  

Satisfied Sample = Score is either 4 or 5 (Score ranges from 0-5)
